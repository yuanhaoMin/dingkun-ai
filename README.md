# GPT Agent for Manufacturing Industry: Voice-Driven Instruction Solution

In the manufacturing industry, particularly in environments like factories in China, traditional GUI-based solutions often face challenges such as:
- Dusty Environments: Dust and debris can make mouse and keyboard operations unreliable and require frequent maintenance.
- Hands-On Workflows: Operators are often engaged in hands-on tasks, making interaction with screens impractical.

GPT acts as a voice-driven assistant to interpret natural language instructions and convert them into actionable commands or operational data.
